## Code design choices

#### Next js

The choice comes because of the ease that Next provides when creating React applications with server-side rendering. In addition to providing performance, SSR enables application pages developed in React to be indexed by search engines.

#### Atomic Design

Today there are many ways to organize components within the application, but the use of Atomic Design particularly pleases me greatly by creating a relationship of "smaller" components at a lower level (atoms) and larger components at a higher level (organisms). But in the end, folder structure, whatever it may be, must define an organization pattern within the project.

#### Storybook

Who ever needed to import a Button component and forgot what kind of state that button can take. Ex: button--large, button--small, button-danger, button-success. The Storybook makes it easy to see a component in all its possible states, and this facilitates future maintenance/refactoring.

#### Dark-theme

It's been one of the features most loved by users and big companies like google, slack, facebook, clubhouse, instagram and whatsapp has been paying a lot of attention to it. I particularly always use it when the interface is available and so I decided to apply it to the challenge.
